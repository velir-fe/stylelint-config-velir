Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 8.45.0

ESLint couldn't find the plugin "eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y".

(The package "eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "/Users/Jeff.Preussner/sites/frontend-toolkit/packages/stylelint".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@latest --save-dev

The plugin "eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y" was referenced from the config file in ".eslintrc Â» ../../.eslintrc.json".

If you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://eslint.org/chat/help to chat with the team.
